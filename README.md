# ScoreKeeperApp
App used to keep score to practice integrating javascript and html together.
Project was used to exercise skills I've already learned. The only bug i encountered for this project was making the html in javascrip be read as a number instead of a string so it could be compared to the winning score the user enters at the beginning of the game. Quickly solved this by using parseInt on the variable referencing the html documnet.
